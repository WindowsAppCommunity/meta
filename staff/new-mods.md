# New moderators

## Basic criteria

1. Member must not ask for the role, unless an Admin trusts them personally. It shows ambition, but it could indicate potential malice.
2. Member must have been in the server for at least 6 months.
3. Member must not have any infractions, and be a positive influence on the community.
4. Member should be active in the server at minimum a few times a week.
5. Optionally, member should be active at times other moderators are offline.

Once selected, we approach the user in DM and ask them about it, answer questions about expectations and responsibility, etc.

## Onboarding FAQ

When first approaching a new mod in DM, these are common questions they might asked, and how we've responded to them in the past.

> **Q**: I'm already super busy as it is. About how much time per week would be required of me?
> 
> **A**: How active you've been in the server was considered when you were nominated. We don't expect you to change that for us.

> **Q**: Am I required to join staff meetings?
> 
> **A**: No, staff meetings are not mandatory. We'll schedule them around our staff's availablity. Join if you can and we'll always post a summary afterwards for the times that you can't.

## Trial run: PreMod
A "PreMod" is a mod-in-training. They appear the color of a moderator, can access staff channels, and learn the ropes of being a moderator without full permission of a moderator.

PreMods watch for rule violations and report them in #staff-chat. Link the relevant conversation and ping an existing mod.

## Graduating to full Moderator

The criteria for graduating from PreMod to Mod is decided by Admins on a case-by-case basis. We'll notify you when you meet that criteria and are ready to graduate.
