## Rules & responsibilities

### Moderators

1. Moderate the chats for rule violations.
2. Keep the general server atmosphere friendly and professional for our members.
3. Moderators are also staff members, and take on the responsibilities of one.

### Staff members

- Let us know if you'll be gone for an extended period of time (a week or more)
- If providing feedback on changes, staff are expected to know the server well enough that their feedback is informed and actionable.
- Staff members implicitly act as role models for the community. Be a positive influence!
- Follow the rules we set for our members. An accountable staff member can do this while acknowledging when they fall short, and can grow when needed. See [Accountability](accountability.md).
- Don't use #infraction-log or #bot-stuff for chat. These are for the bots to post in.
- Optionally, join our staff meetings whenever possible. We'll always coordinate scheduling these with our staff, and we'll always post a summary of staff meetings for those who miss it.

### Approving newly registered projects

Staff can manually approve new projects on the Windows App Community website.

You'll need to verify that the Discord account which registered the app *actually* belongs to the app developer.

For example, if the project is hosted on GitHub, just check that they've linked that GitHub account to Discord (or ask them to).

Otherwise, verify using official contact info:
- Find the project in search results (Bing, Google, etc) or Microsoft store.
- Find official contact info
- Send them a brief email or DM explaining that
  - Their project X was registered with us by user Y.
  - We're reaching out to verify ownership of the project.
  - If they don't respond in 30 days, we'll delete the registration request.
- DM the Discord account that registered this project, asking to respond to the message sent via an alternate channel (known email, social media) to complete registration.
