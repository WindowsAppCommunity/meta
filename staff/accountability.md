# Accountability

Accountability helps to foster a positive and healthy server culture where staff members respect each other and uphold the serverâ€™s standards.

To live is to make mistakes and learn from them. Just as a normal server member would, an accountable staff member acknowledges errors when they happen and does their best to grow from them.

## Infractions
The infraction system is one way we encourage this. It's designed to give opportunities to grow and consequences when you don't, and applies to both server members and staff members.

If a staff member is issued an infraction, they lose any staff-related roles and access to staff channels. Their position will be restored under these conditions:
- The infraction must expire completely.
- We'll link you to the original infraction, and collect your feedback on the situation, moderation process, etc., before further internal discussion.
  1. Do you still want to be a mod?
  2. Do you understand why you were given an infraction?
  3. Do you think the infraction was fair? If not, why?
  4. Do you feel like you can continue working with the other staff members?
- To make sure internal conflict is resolved, remaining staff will discuss and must unanimously agree on if re-entry is allowed.
- Discussions will continue (with additional feedback from you) until a decision has been reached.
