## Prerequisites:
- If you're contributing towards another project, make sure that project is registered with us.
- Have a specific goal in mind. Project changes must add value that consumers will notice.

## How it works

1. During registration for Make, you state a goal that you'd like to reach.
2. Once the events starts, start working towards your goal. Collaborate with others in the community to reach your goal faster.
3. We'll check in with you after the event to see if you've reached your goal.

### What you can register

Anything that can be registered with the community can take part in the Make event:

- Apps
- Code Libraries
- New projects
- Existing projects:
   - Performance improvements
   - Bug bashes
   - Visual updates
   - New features

## Entry requirements

> **Coming soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è**

Registration closes 3 days before event starts

Staff may review your submission up to 2 weeks before the event begins.

## Exit requirements
When the Make event has ended, you'll be provided with an exit form to fill out.

We'll ask you questions such as:
- Did you complete your goal?
- Do you plan on continuing the work? What's next?
- What's a particularly useful piece of feedback you've received from someone outside your project?
- Did you learn anything new or useful that may help you again later?

This form MUST be filled out to receive credit for the event.
