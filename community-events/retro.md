Retro occurs at the end of each Appathon and is a chance to answer questions from the community, share your progress you made, and shape/share your future plans.

## Editors notes

Show the incremental value or learnings to the community.

- Exit form to gather information about your experience.
- A story of your dev journey in the make event
- The same questions we asked to create the blog posts for Launch in the past
- Must be text form (done on the website)
- Optionally presented.
  - Can use the form data to outline their presentation, as an aid.
- Document failure causes as part of retro?

If didn't meet your Make goal, but if you finished outside of the event, you can simply join the Retro instead of going through Make again.
