## Why register?

- Projects register here so they can build and engage with their own and the broader community, and so that the community can engage with them.
- We moderate public chats and deal with trolls, raiders, spammers, etc., so you don't have to.
- See, manage and grow your project's developers, beta testers, translators, patreons, supporters and more alongside the community.
- Provide your users with a direct communication channel to report issues, give feedback, etc.
- Participate in community events, and collaborate with others.

### Publishers

All projects have an associated publisher, whether it has shipped to users or not.

- Publishers are those with permission to push changes to users.
- Your "publisher" can be as big as a company, or as small as a simple screen name.
- Examples of this are the CommunityToolkit, Valley Software, FireCube Studios, Joefinnapps, etc.
- A single publisher can register multiple projects.
- If needed, a single user can register multiple publishers under a larger publisher.

### Apps

We welcome all types of apps, including and beyond those that run on Windows. 

### Libraries

Examples include the CommunityToolkit, OwlCore, ComputeSharp, OneToolkit, etc.

Registering your library yields the same benefits as registering an app.
- Direct real-time communication between library developers and user.
- Participate in community events.
- etc.

### Platforms

Uno Platform, WinUI, React Native, MAUI.

Talk to an Admin to get started. Before registering, we'll chat 1-on-1 to accommodate the needs of your platform.

## Dedicated Channels

You may be eligible for a dedicated channel. There are two types:

### Publisher channels
Used when you have a lot of projects with a relatively small audience.

- Your publisher name will be used to create your channel name (if you have a registered project, you're a publisher).

### Project channels
When you have a single project with a larger audience to serve.

- Your project name will be used to create your channel name.

### Using a channel

How you use a channel is up to you, but it must remain somewhat active.

Ways to use a channel
- Share new projects, updates, designs, features, etc.
- Collab with or gather feedback from users or other devs.
- Communicate with your private testing group.
- Gather design suggestions
- Crowd-source translation for your project
- Conduct polls

## How to register

To maintain a healthy community, project or publisher channel eligibility is determined on a case-by-case basis.

As mentioned above, a channel can be used for anything the owner would like. As long as the channel stays active and follows our code of conduct, we're happy to host you-- whether you're a full-fledged platform or an indie dev with prospective potential.
