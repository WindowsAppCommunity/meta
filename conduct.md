# ⚖️ Code of conduct

To create an atmosphere where everyone feels welcome, we expect our community members to follow these rules.  

### 1. **Be respectful**
Treat others how they'd like to be treated (as per Xbox, play by the [Platinum rule](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/friends-social-activity/share-socialize/platinum-rule)).

### 2. **Use the proper channel**
Check the channel description if you're not sure. Post in [`#dev-help`](https://discord.com/channels/372137812037730304/1053022580266770466) for help, do not send unsolicited help DMs.

### 3. **Strictly SFW**
NSFW content is not allowed in any form and will be immediately removed.

### 4. **No swearing**
Keep it civil and professional. Bypassing the filter will result in a rule violation.

### 5. **Don't spam**
- No spam, nonsense, or purposely confusing others. Sending mass messages (public or DM) will result in an immediate ban.
- Unsolicited pings or DMs are not allowed. Use appropriate feedback channels (here, GitHub) for projects or @Mod if you need assistance related to activity in the server in a specific channel.

### 6. **No politics**
We don't allow any political discussion to avoid creating hostility.

### 7. **No Trolling/Baiting**
Any actions that cause problems or provoke others are not allowed. This includes nicknames, profile pictures and messages or memes you post.

### 8. **Don't block Admins/bots**
 To keep things running smoothly, blocking admins or bots is not allowed.

### 9. **English only**
To help us moderate chat easily, please keep non-English conversations to DMs.

### 10. **Don't leak projects**
Some community projects are private, or have private features in the works. Infractions involving leaks have varying severity, and may result in an immediate ban at the project owner's discretion. Also covered by rule 1.

### 11. **Keep it legal**
Illegal things are not allowed, and neither is anything that could easily lead to illegal things. This includes leaking information under non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). If we're contacted, we may remove your messages and issue an infraction or ban depending on the severity.
